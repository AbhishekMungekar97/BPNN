Backpropagation algorithm (Without using TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch)
- This algorithm is amongst the most basic neural networks-based machine learning algorithm, which tries capturing all the key features of a given dataset in terms of interconnecting weights.
- The tqdm library has been utilized to keep track of the progress in training the model.
